    "## A few scatter plots show relations between ratings and Delivery options and it is clearly seen the Delivery options may it be Takeaway or Home Delivery ratings are not affected by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Higher concentration of Restaurants is in the Koregaon Park(223),Baner(208), Kalyani Nagar(113),FC Road(102),Phoenix Market City(98),Viman Nagar(98),Kothrud(90) localities with ratings greater than 4 which tells us that starting a Restaurant in these locations will yeild more food enthusiasts and more income.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Price Range also shows that Koregaon Park has a higher overall price range which is 4 and serves all kinds of courses in that locality.Also the map shows a pretty high concentration of restaurants in the central part as I have told before. \n",
